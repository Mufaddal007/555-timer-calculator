# 555-timer-calculator
A small script to calculate 555 timer output signal parameters, with provided r1, r2, and c1 values, and vice versa. 
As soon as you launch the file, you will be presented with a text based connection diagram, of 555 timer IC in Astable mode, there are four main variables of the equations, 
timer period, r1, r2, and c1 , three of which are required to calulate the fourth unknown variable, and thus it will calculate the other parameters. Just enter the known variables in 
their place and put the question mark symbol in place of unknown variable.
